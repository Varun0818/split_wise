### Project Architecture Flow
1. User Authentication
   
   - Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles.
   - Authentication is handled using Django's built-in authentication system.
2. Group Management
   
   - Users can create groups and become the admin of those groups.
   - Admins can add or remove members from the group.
   - Each group has a list of members and associated expenses.
3. Expense Management
   
   - Users can add expenses to a group.
   - Expenses can be split among group members based on predefined criteria (equally, by percentage, etc.).
   - Users can view the history of expenses for each group.
4. Settlement Management
   
   - The application calculates the net balance for each member in a group.
   - Users can view settlement summaries to see who owes whom and how much.
   - Settlements can be recorded to update balances.
5. Data Export
   
   - Users can export expense data to CSV format for offline access.
   - This feature is available for both group-specific and user-specific expense histories.
6. Recurring Expenses
   
   - Users can set up recurring expenses that automatically add to the group's expenses at specified intervals.
### Components and Interactions
- Frontend :
  
  - HTML templates and CSS for rendering the user interface.
  - Forms for user input and interaction.
- Backend :
  
  - Django views handle HTTP requests and responses.
  - Business logic for managing groups, expenses, and settlements.
- Database :
  
  - Models define the structure of data (e.g., User, Group, Expense, Debt).
  - Queries are optimized using Django ORM and raw SQL where necessary.
- Security :
  
  - Access control ensures only authorized users can perform certain actions (e.g., only group admins can add members).
  - Data validation and error handling are implemented to maintain data integrity.
